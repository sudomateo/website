Hello everyone, I'm Matthew Sanabria.

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in distributed systems, observability, and
scaling infrastructure. I'm known for expert debugging skills, exceptional
leadership, and using my breadth and depth of knowledge to unblock others and
add value in minimal context situations. Let's talk about developing backend
systems in Go and Rust, writing frontend logic using TypeScript and your
framework of choice, or anything Linux, containers, and infrastructure.

I'm a mentor that's taught and upleveled hundreds of aspiring and current
engineers, helping them understand complex technical concepts, land their first
job in the industry, and earn promotions. Let's talk about the difference
between mentorship and sponsorship, how to break down complex concepts for
others, and raising the bar of technical excellence.

I'm a speaker that's able to give that last-minute, unplanned talk at your
conference because I have a ton of experience to talk about and I'm not afraid
to grab the microphone. Let's talk about community building, bringing your real
self to the conversation, and communicating with clarity, honesty, integrity,
and kindness.

If you're the type of person that needs to see credentials before you'll believe
in someone, then here are some of mine.

- Extensive experience across the stack as a Software Engineer, Support
  Engineer, and Site Reliability Engineer.
- Created and taught the Ultimate Terraform course at [Ardan
  Labs](https://www.ardanlabs.com/).
- Served as the Mentoring Chair for [GoBridge](https://gobridge.org).
- Authored concepts and exercises for the Go track on
  [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).
- Created an entirely new curriculum for the IT 340 course at [New Jersey
  Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu/).
- Mentored and trained aspiring engineers in the [100Devs
  bootcamp](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/).

Outside of technology, I enjoy spending time with my beautiful family,
traveling, working out, reading books, working on my next house project, riding
my motorcycle, and training with firearms.
