I often get asked about the gear I use or what's on my desk. This page lists
the gear I use both personally and professionally along with some thoughts about
the gear to provide context. I've built up this collection over time and I'll
do my best to keep this page up to date as things change. Generally, I have the
following principles when buying gear.

* Understand compatibility with existing gear.
* Prefer wired gear over wireless gear.
* Favor gear that is repairable and extensible.
* Extend the budget if the value is there.

## Desk & Chair

### DeskHaus Vertex Pro Diamond 4-Leg Frame

I believe this model has been discontinued in favor of the [Apex Pro
Max](https://desk.haus/products/apex-pro-max).

I've only ever used IKEA table tops and legs before this desk. I
extensively researched DeskHaus and ultimately decided to go with their
standing desk frame based on Reddit reviews and the [DeskHaus YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Deskhaus). This is the best desk frame I've
ever used in my life, **period**. UPLIFT, Fully, and Autonomous desks aren't
even in the same league as DeskHaus. It's heavy and _extremely_ stable even when
raised to its maximum height. I have the 30" legs, extended range height, and
programmable switch.

### DeskHaus Solid Wood 1.75" Work Surface

[Link](https://desk.haus/products/solid-wood)

I wanted real, solid wood as the top for my desk frame and DeskHaus stocked
solid wood tops so I bought one with my desk. Much like the frame, it's also
heavy and the finish is great. I have a 30"x72" Walnut top and I love it.
If I could do it again I probably would have just bought a top from a local
woodworker to save on cost and have more control over style and finish.

### Herman Miller Embody

[Link](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/embody-chairs/)

I've only ever used IKEA chairs before this chair. I figured it was time to get
a real chair since I spend a good deal of time sitting for work. I went with
this chair since the company I worked for at the time had a company discount.
It's been a great chair and the warranty is fantastic. I've used the warranty
to replace the bottom fabric after it lifted in a few areas. I have the Canyon
fabric.

### Grovemade Matte Desk Pad

[Link](https://grovemade.com/product/matte-desk-pad)

I had a SteelSeries desk pad previously but its rubber bottom didn't let my
wooden desk breathe and would dull the finish after extended use. The cork
bottom on this Grovemade desk pad lets my wooden desk breathe much better and
I always wanted to try a Grovemade product. I purchased the Dark Green color in
the Medium Plus.

## Computer

### Custom Workstation

[Link](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/x7Y9TW)

This is my personal workstation. The complete parts list is in the above link
but it's an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D, 256 GiB of memory, an AMD 9070 XT, and a 4 TiB
NVMe. I use this for everything from programming to content creation. It runs
Arch Linux because it's the year of Linux on the desktop and everything I do
finally works on Linux. Additionally, Windows has frustrated me to the point
I'll likely never go back to it and Apple's pricing is... Apple.

### Framework Desktop

[Link](https://frame.work/products/desktop-diy-amd-aimax300)

This is my work machine. It's the 128 GiB model and it packs a serious
punch compared to the Framework Laptop 16. It runs Arch Linux and quite
frankly has enough power to rival my custom workstation. There's some [PSU
noise](https://community.frame.work/t/noisy-psu-fan/74751) that's annoying
myself and others but hopefully Framework will correct that. I have a support
ticket in for it.

### Framework Laptop 16

[Link](https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040)

This is my work travel machine. I used to use this as my only work machine
but I wanted more power for compiling code and video editing so I relinquished
this to travel duty. Looking back I probably should have gotten a Framework
Laptop 13 instead for travel. I published a [review of the Framework Laptop
16](https://youtu.be/1-WUGfn6wW0) on YouTube if you're curious what my thoughts
are on it.

## Computer Peripherals

### Dell U4025QW

[Link](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-40-curved-thunderbolt-hub-monitor-u4025qw/apd/210-bmdp/monitors-monitor-accessories)

I bought this monitor after using my two ASUS PB258Q monitors for 10 years
with a quick stint using an LG 27UD68P-B. Initially, I was planning on buying
either a 27" 5K or a 32" 6K monitor but there weren't any that had above a 60Hz
refresh rate. I ended up buying this monitor since it's 5K at 120Hz and supports
Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, really USB4 in my case. It's lower pixels per inch
(PPI) than I wanted but the text is still lovely at 200% scale. I love that it
has a built-in KVM switch which allowed me to get rid of my dock and USB switch.

This monitor uses multi-stream transport (MST) to split the monitor into
sections for one computer to treat as two monitors or two computers to treat as
one monitor. I use its 50%/50% mode with one computer if I want to act like I
have two monitors (e.g., for screen sharing one monitor and not the other) and I
use its 50%/50% mode with two computers where one computer uses one half and the
other computer uses the other half. If I'm not doing either of those things I'll
just use its 100% mode as a single monitor.

### ZSA Moonlander

[Link](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander)

My keyboard journey has been long.

* Das Keyboard 4 Professional
* Drop CTRL
* Drop Preonic
* ZSA Moonlander
* Kinesis Advantage360 SmartSet (Customized by Upgrade Keyboards)

I loved my Preonic but typing on it kept my shoulders and chest closed which
wasn't great for posture and health. Ultimately I decided to bite the bullet and
try a split keyboard. At the time the Moonlander just released so it was a good
time to give it a go. I also really liked ZSA's stance on sustainability which
they discussed more on [Changelog Interviews #608](https://changelog.fm/608).
Unfortunately I don't have long fingers so I found the concave design of the
Kinesis Advantage360 to be more comfortable for me so I ordered a custom one
from Upgrade Keyboards. I love this thing. I would skip all the other keyboards
I've tried and go directly to a concave, split layout if I started again. I have
a grey model with blank keycaps and lubed TTC Silent Bluish White V2 switches.

### Logitech MX Master 3S

[Link](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/mx-master-3s)

Pour one out for the legendary Logitech G9x. I haven't found a mouse that I
loved as much as the Logitech G9x. I had a Logitech G502 X but it had too much
of a gamer look with crevices that just filled with grime. I switched to the MX
Master 3S on people's recommendations but I'm not sold on it. I'm still in the
market for a mouse.

## Writing

### LAMY safari Fountain Pen

[Link](https://www.lamy.com/en-us/p/lamy-safari-fountain-pen)

Even though I work with computers I prefer physical writing to digital writing.
Fountain pens are fun to write with and helped reignite my joy for writing.
These LAMY safari pens are inexpensive and a popular choice for fountain pens
users. I have a Yellow pen with a Fine nib filled with Ancient Copper ink and an
Umbra pen Fine nib filled with green ink.

### Platinum Plaisir Fountain Pen

[Link](https://www.jetpens.com/Platinum-Plaisir-Fountain-Pens/ct/1054)

Everything I love about fountain pens with a better seal than the LAMY to
prevent drying when not in use. I have a Red pen with a Fine nib filled with
Carbon Black ink.

### LEUCHTTURM1917 Notebook

[Link](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebooks/notebook-editions/classic-notebooks/)

Notebooks are ultimately a preference. My co-hosts on
[Fallthrough](https://fallthrough.fm) convinced me to try a LEUCHTTURM1917
notebook and I love it. My friend at [Skriptble Press](https://skriptble.press/)
convinced me to try the B5 paper size and it's much better than the smaller A5
size I was used to. Paired with a fountain pen, a LEUCHTTURM1917 notebook is a
great way to take notes and plan. I have a Classic Notebook and a Weekly Planner
and Notebook, both in B5 size and hardcover.

## Audio

### Shure SM7B

[Link](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7b)

I had a Blue Yeti previously and I didn't care for its mini USB connection
and audio quality so I upgraded to the Shure SM7B. Honestly I didn't do much
research here I just went with the microphone that was most popular with content
creators on Twitch and YouTube. Perhaps I should have done more research here
since I ended up buying a Cloudlifter CL-1 and Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (3rd Gen)
to drive this microphone before swapping those out for the Rode Rodecaster Duo.

### Rode Rodecaster Duo

[Link](https://rode.com/en-us/interfaces-and-mixers/rodecaster-series/rodecaster-duo)

I replaced the Cloudlifter CL-1, Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (3rd Gen), and Schiit
Vali 2 with this Rodecaster Duo and I should have just bit the bullet up front
and got this device way sooner. I have USB 1 plugged into one workstation so
that it gets access to 2 inputs and 2 outputs for separating general audio from
background audio like Discord chat or music. Then I have USB 2 plugged into
my other workstation to get 1 input and 1 output. This allows me to share my
microphone and headphones with both computers without ever having to switch
cables or connections. Love this thing!

### Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro

[Link](https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/p/dt-990-pro)

I bought two pairs of these headphones because I loved the first pair so much
and didn't want to be without them when I sent them off for repair. These are
great for everyday use in meetings, watching content, and listening to podcasts.
I love that they are open-back so my ears breathe and I can hear my dogs fussing
around in the room when I'm working. There's good third-party support for
repairing them and getting new parts which I've done a few times in the many
years I've had them. I have the 250 Ohms model.

## Video

### Panasonic Lumix S5IIX

[Link](https://shop.panasonic.com/products/s5m2x-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-body)

This is the first professional camera I've ever purchased. I use it as a webcam
for meetings, streaming, creating videos, and as a camera to take product
pictures for my wife's chocolate business,
[Lily & Sparrow](https://lilyandsparrow.net). I like this camera because it has
a fan to keep it cool when recording for a long time and the Panasonic family
of lenses are pretty great. I use the
[S Series 20-60mm F3.5-5.6 L-Mount Lens](https://shop.panasonic.com/products/s-series-20-60mm-f3-5-5-6-asph-lens).
I was also pretty frustrated with the color on USB webcams and wanted to
fix that. I'm not a photographer by any means but I'm quite happy with this
purchase.

### Blackmagic Design DeckLink Mini Recorder 4K

[Link](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/decklink)

I bought this capture card to use in my custom workstation. I had an Elgato card
before this but Elgato doesn't support Linux so I gave that card away for free.
This card supports Linux at a lower price point than Magewell cards and I've
used Blackmagic Design's DaVinci Resolve video editor before so I was familiar
with the brand.

### Blackmagic Design UltraStudio Recorder 3G

[Link](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/ultrastudio)

I bought this capture card to connect my camera to whatever machine needs it,
even when traveling. It connects using Thunderbolt 3, really USB4 in my case,
to provide data and power. This card supports Linux at a lower price point than
Magewell cards and I've used Blackmagic Design's DaVinci Resolve video editor
before so I was familiar with the brand.

## Lighting

### Amaran P60x LED Panel

[Link](https://amarancreators.com/pages/amaran-p60x)

I have two of these lights to help balance lighting in my office. I have four
windows in my office and I noticed that there are shadows on my face at certain
times of the day. These lights remove those shadows and keep me looking great
regardless what time it is.

## Rigging

### Smallrig Encore DT-30 Desk Mount

[Link](https://www.smallrig.com/SmallRig-Encore-DT-30-Desk-Mount-with-Holding-Arm-3992.html)

I have three of these that hold up my camera and two lights. They are strong,
adjustable, and from a popular, reputable rigging brand.

### Smallrig Aluminum Panoramic Ball Head

[Link](https://www.smallrig.com/smallrig-aluminum-panoramic-ball-head-3034.html)

I have three of these to mount my camera and two lights to rigging. The quick
disconnect feature is great when I want to take my camera with me without
ruining its placement at my desk.
