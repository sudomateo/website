I often get asked about the gear I use or what's on my desk. This page lists
the gear I use both personally and professionally along with some thoughts about
the gear to provide context. I've built up this collection over time and I'll
do my best to keep this page up to date as things change. Generally, I have the
following principles when buying gear.

* Understand compatibility with existing gear.
* Prefer wired gear over wireless gear.
* Favor gear that is repairable and extensible.
* Extend the budget if the value is there.

## Desk & Chair

### DeskHaus Vertex Pro Diamond 4-Leg Frame

[Link](https://desk.haus/products/vertex-pro-diamond-4-leg)

I've only ever used IKEA table tops and legs before buying a serious desk. I
extensively researched DeskHaus and ultimately decided to go with their standing
desk frame based on Reddit reviews and the
[DeskHaus YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Deskhaus). This is the best
desk I've ever used in my life, **period**. UPLIFT, Fully, and Autonomous desks
aren't even in the same league as DeskHaus. It's quite heavy and _extremely_
stable even when raised to its maximum height. I have the 30" legs, extended
range height, and programmable switch.

### DeskHaus Solid Wood 1.75" Work Surface

[Link](https://desk.haus/products/solid-wood)

I needed a top for my standing desk frame and I wanted real, solid wood.
DeskHaus stocked solid wood tops so I bought one with my desk. Much like the
frame, it's also quite heavy and the finish is great. I have a 30"x72" Walnut
top and I love it. If I could do it again I probably would have just bought a
top from a local woodworker to save on cost and have more control over style
and finish.

### Herman Miller Embody

[Link](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/embody-chairs/)

I've only ever used IKEA chairs and I figured it was time to get a real chair
since I spend a good deal of time sitting for work. I went with this chair
since the company I worked for at the time had a company discount. It's been a
great chair and the warranty is fantastic. I've used the warranty to replace the
bottom fabric after it lifted in a few areas. I have the Canyon fabric since I
like red and orange colors.

### Grovemade Matte Desk Pad

[Link](https://grovemade.com/product/matte-desk-pad)

I purchased this but it hasn't arrived yet so I'll update when it arrives. I had
a SteelSeries desk pad previously but it didn't let the wooden desk breathe. I
figured the cork bottom on this desk pad would let the wooden desk breathe much
better. I purchased the Dark Green color in the Medium Plus size.

## Computer

### Framework Laptop 16

[Link](https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040)

I have two of these laptops, one for personal use and one for work. Both run
Fedora and are maxed out with the exception that the work model has 96 GiB of
memory and the GPU module while the personal model has 64 GiB of memory and no
GPU module. This laptop feels very much like a v1 product in both a good and bad
way which I described in
[this post on X](https://x.com/sudomateo/status/1886843887727136913).
Even so, I'm happy with my purchase and enjoy supporting a company that's
tackling the repairable laptop space. I find myself using this laptop much
more than my desktop which is surprising since I historically favored using
a desktop.

### Custom Desktop

[Link](https://pcpartpicker.com/b/CRx6Mp)

I built a desktop back in 2021. You can find the complete parts list in the
above link but it's an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X with 128 GiB of memory and 2 TiB NVMe.
It runs Fedoar and for the last few years this was my only personal machine.
Nowadays I really only use it for more intense video editing or as a server to
run virtual machines and share storage over the network.

## Computer Peripherals

### ZSA Moonlander

[Link](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander)

My keyboard journey has been long to say the least. Here's the journey in a nutshell.

* Das Keyboard 4 Professional
* Drop CTRL
* Drop Preonic
* ZSA Moonlander

I loved my Preonic but typing on it kept my shoulders and chest closed which
wasn't great for posture and health. Ultimately I decided to bite the bullet and
try a split keyboard. At the time the Moonlander just released so it was a good
time to give it a go. I also really liked ZSA's stance on sustainability which
they discussed more on [Changelog Interviews #608](https://changelog.fm/608). If
I had to buy a split keyboard again today it would be a tough decision between
the ZSA Moonlander and the Kinesis Advantage360 Pro. I have the Dark Matter
color with blank keycaps and lubed Zilent V2 switches.

### Logitech G502 X

[Link](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g502-x-wired-lightforce.910-006136.html)

Pour one out for the legendary Logitech G9x. The Logitech G502 X mouse is the
closest I've come to my beloved Logitech G9x. People say to use the Logitech MX
Master but I tried that and it wasn't great for me. I have the wired version of
this mouse and it works for my needs.

### Anker 778

[Link](https://www.anker.com/products/a83a9)

I used to have the Dell WD19TB dock but it was Thunderbolt 3 and causing my
peripherals to rapidly disconnect and reconnect so I swapped it out for the
Anker 778 since it's Thunderbolt 4. My Framework 16 has USB4 ports which is
fully supported by Thunderbolt 4. As an added bonus this dock also supports
Multi-Stream Transport (MST) so I can connect multiple displays to the dock and
use it as an MST hub.

### Sabrent USB 3.0 Switch (USB-SW30)

[Link](https://sabrent.com/products/usb-sw30)

I needed a way to switch between my desktop and laptop without swapping a
bunch of cables. I have a powered USB hub plugged into this switch with all my
peripherals on it. Then this switch is plugged into both my desktop and laptop.
Switching is just a press of this button and an input switch on my monitor.
Not bad.

### Sabrent 10-Port 60W USB 3.0 Hub (HB-BU10)

[Link](https://sabrent.com/products/hb-bu10)

I went with a powered USB hub so it could adequately power my peripherals and
slowly charge things if necessary. All my peripherals are plugged into this,
including my audio interface. The only thing I'll note is there can be line
noise from the USB ports if you have multiple devices plugged in. I noticed
this when I heard line noise while monitoring the audio interface output. When I
unplugged all other devices from the hub or plugged the audio interface directly
into the computer the line noise disappeared. Perhaps I can replace this with
a USB hub that has better shielding but I'm considering eliminating this device
altogether by running my desktop headless and just using the laptop as my
primary machine. We'll see.

### Roost V3 Laptop Stand

[Link](https://www.therooststand.com/collections/roost-laptop-stand/products/roost-v3-roost-laptop-stand)

This laptop stand is cool because it collapses nicely for travel but it's _way_
too expensive for what it is. It also doesn't adjust to a low enough height for
for my liking. I wouldn't buy this again unless the price dropped by 50%.

## Writing

### LAMY safari Fountain Pen

[Link](https://www.lamy.com/en-us/p/lamy-safari-fountain-pen)

Even though I work with computers I prefer physical writing to digital writing.
Fountain pens are fun to write with and helped reignite my joy for writing.
These LAMY safari pens are inexpensive and a popular choice for fountain pens
users. I have a Yellow pen with a Fine nib that I use for most of my writing and
an Umbra pen with an Extra Fine nib that I use for drawing detailed diagrams.

### LEUCHTTURM1917 Notebook

[Link](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebooks/notebook-editions/classic-notebooks/)

Notebooks are ultimately a preference. My co-hosts on
[Fallthrough](https://fallthrough.fm) convinced me to try a LEUCHTTURM1917
notebook and I love it. My friend at [Skriptble Press](https://skriptble.press/)
convinced me to try the B5 paper size and it's much better than the smaller A5
size I was used to. Paired with a fountain pen, a LEUCHTTURM1917 notebook is a
great way to take notes and plan. I have a Classic Notebook and a Weekly Planner
and Notebook, both in B5 size and hardcover.

## Audio

### Shure SM7B

[Link](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7b)

I had a Blue Yeti previously and I didn't care for its mini USB connection
and audio quality so I upgraded to the Shure SM7B. Honestly I didn't do much
research here I just went with the microphone that was most popular with content
creators on Twitch and YouTube. Perhaps I should have done more research since I
had to buy a preamp to really get the most out of this microphone with my audio
interface.

### Cloud Microphones Cloudlifter CL-1

[Link](https://www.cloudmicrophones.com/cloudlifter-cl-1)

I picked up this preamp to increase the gain on my SM7B before the input gets
to my audio interface. If I did more research upfront I could have gotten a more
powerful audio interface instead of buying this. It works well though and made
my SM7B much better for my use case. When I first bought it I forgot to buy an
extra XLR cable so remember to do that if you buy one for yourself.

### Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (3rd Gen)

[Link](https://us.focusrite.com/products/scarlett-2i2-3rd-gen)

I needed an audio interface to receive the input from my microphone to so I
picked this up. I really like this audio interface but I don't find it powerful
enough to drive the SM7B without a preamp. That is, unless you want the SM7B
right up on them lips. I could have gotten away with the Scarlett Solo which
only has one XLR input since I never use the second input on my Scarlett 2i2.
Get the 4th Gen if you want the inputs on the back of the device instead of the
front like the 3rd Gen. I also use this to transmit the output audio from my
computer to my headphone amp and speakers. It's a great little box honestly.

### Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro

[Link](https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/p/dt-990-pro)

I bought two pairs of these headphones because I loved the first pair so much
and didn't want to be without them when I sent them off for repair. These are
great for everyday use in meetings, watching content, and listening to podcasts.
I love that they are open-back so my ears breathe and I can hear my dogs fussing
around in the room when I'm working. There's good third-party support for
repairing them and getting new parts which I've done a few times in the many
years I've had them. I have the 250 Ohms model.

### Schiit Vali 2

[Link](https://www.schiit.com/products/vali3)

The link above is for the newer Vali 3 but I have the Vali 2. This headphone
amp drives my DT 990 Pro headphones well and lets me hear things I haven't heard
before in songs and video games. I used to play a lot of Rust where sound is
important so having an amp drive my headphones was a great experience. This amp
also has a line output to send audio to another device when the headphones are
unplugged. I use this to send audio to my speakers when I don't want to wear
headphones.

### Micca PB42X Powered Bookshelf Speakers

[Link](https://www.miccatron.com/micca-pb42x-powered-bookshelf-speakers/)

When I'm not using my headphones I'm using these speakers. The audio is clear
and they are powered so I don't need an amp to drive them. My only issue with
these speakers is their size. If I were to do it again I'd buy smaller speakers
that didn't take up so much room on my desk. I guess I could buy desk mounts to
raise the speaker off my desk but... eh.

## Video

### Panasonic Lumix S5IIX

[Link](https://shop.panasonic.com/products/s5m2x-full-frame-mirrorless-camera-body)

This is the first professional camera I've ever purchased. I use it as a webcam
for meetings, streaming, creating videos, and as a camera to take product
pictures for my wife's chocolate business,
[Lily & Sparrow](https://lilyandsparrow.net). I like this camera because it has
a fan to keep it cool when recording for a long time and the Panasonic family
of lenses are pretty great. I use the
[S Series 20-60mm F3.5-5.6 L-Mount Lens](https://shop.panasonic.com/products/s-series-20-60mm-f3-5-5-6-asph-lens).
I was also pretty frustrated with the color on USB webcams and wanted to
fix that. I'm not a photographer by any means but I'm quite happy with this
purchase.

### OREI 4K HDMI Splitter 1-In-2-Out

[Link](https://www.orei.com/products/uhds102-ultrahd-1-in-2-hdmi-splitter)

My camera is connected to this HDMI splitter to send the video signal to both my
desktop and laptop. I bought this solely because I got tired swapping the HDMI
cables connected to my camera when switching between my laptop and desktop.

### Blackmagic Design DeckLink Mini Recorder 4K

[Link](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/decklink)

I bought this capture card to connect my camera to my desktop. I had an Elgato
card before this but Elgato doesn't support Linux so I gave that card away
for free. This card supports Linux at a lower price point than Magewell cards
and I've used Blackmagic Design's DaVinci Resolve video editor before so I was
familiar with the brand.

### Blackmagic Design UltraStudio Recorder 3G

[Link](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/ultrastudio)

I bought this capture card to connect my camera to my laptop at home and when
traveling. It connects using Thunderbolt 3 to provide data and power. This
card supports Linux at a lower price point than Magewell cards and I've used
Blackmagic Design's DaVinci Resolve video editor before so I was familiar with
the brand.

## Lighting

### Amaran P60x LED Panel

[Link](https://amarancreators.com/pages/amaran-p60x)

I have two of these lights to help balance lighting in my office. I have four
windows in my office and I noticed that there are shadows on my face at certain
times of the day. These lights remove those shadows and keep me looking great
regardless what time it is.

## Rigging

### Smallrig Encore DT-30 Desk Mount

[Link](https://www.smallrig.com/SmallRig-Encore-DT-30-Desk-Mount-with-Holding-Arm-3992.html)

I have three of these that hold up my camera and two lights. They are strong,
adjustable, and from a popular, reputable rigging brand.

### Smallrig Aluminum Panoramic Ball Head

[Link](https://www.smallrig.com/smallrig-aluminum-panoramic-ball-head-3034.html)

I have three of these to mount my camera and two lights to rigging. The quick
disconnect feature is great when I want to take my camera with me without
ruining its placement at my desk.
