I expanded my use of AI both personally and professionally and I've come to
realize how valuable it is, particularly for adults. Before I dive into the
details let me define what I mean by adult. There are two definitions for adult.

1. relating to or typical of adults; displaying proper maturity
1. dealing in or with explicitly sexual material

I'm not referring to the sexual definition of adult, even if some people see AI
as the latest "sexy" thing in the technology space. I'm referring to the first
definition, specifically that an adult is a mature, independent person with
responsibilities that compete for their time irrespective of their age. With
that in mind, the following personas qualify as adults in my book.

* An 18-year-old teenager paying their way through college.
* A mother or father working and studying for a career pivot.
* An established professional with or without dependants.

The commonality between these personas, and the primary reason why I believe
AI is valuable to them, is all of these personas have real responsibilities
that are competing for their time. Responsibilities that they cannot ignore.
Responsibilities that place tension between personal growth and career growth.
They are no longer a dependent that can stay up late playing video games on
their parents' dime. They no longer have after-hours free time to study or work
on a side project.

I believe such adults should embrace AI in their personal and professional
lives.

## My Decision to Embrace AI

Much like you, dear reader, I have a limited amount of time to spend doing the
various things I both need to do and want to do. Time is a scarce resource which
intrinsically makes it a valuable resource. I'm not someone that believes one
person's time is more valuable than another person's time. I personally believe
that mindset is elitist and selfish but that's a topic for another day. What
I do believe though, is everyone should reflect on the value of their own time
and use that to make changes in their life. That's what I did when I decided to
embrace AI.

I looked at my life and where I was spending time. Here's a non-exhaustive list
of things I was spending time on. My responsibilities, if you will.

<!-- * Attend church on Sunday to the best of our ability. Sometimes we'd miss due to -->
<!-- other conflicting responsibilities. -->
<!-- * Be a loving husband to my beautiful wife. Quality time, dates, communicating, -->
<!-- and even that second definition of adult. -->
<!-- * Work at my full-time job. Money is necessary to pay the bills, especially for -->
<!-- a single-income household. -->
<!-- * Help my wife with her chocolate business, [Lily & -->
<!-- Sparrow](https://lilyandsparrow.net). Often this requires working on the -->
<!-- weekends. -->
<!-- * Strengthen physical, mental, and spiritual health. Exercise, reading, writing, -->
<!-- meditation, and vacation. -->
<!-- * Build and maintain relationships with others. Family, friends, colleagues, -->
<!-- and associates. -->
<!-- * Keep up with routine things. Cooking, cleaning, home chores, home projects, -->
<!-- dog care, car care, etc. -->
<!-- * Personal and career growth. Organize meetups, attend conferences, content -->
<!-- creation, studying, and building. -->

* Attend church on Sunday.
* Be a loving husband to my beautiful wife.
* Work at my full-time job.
* Help my wife with her chocolate business, [Lily & Sparrow][lily-sparrow].
* Strengthen physical, mental, and spiritual health.
* Build and maintain relationships with others.
* Keep up with routine chores and activities.
* Grow personally and professionally.

That's... a lot - and I don't even have children! I looked at everything I
was doing and immediately cut out what I could. I ended relationships, stepped
down from organizing meetups, adjusted my exercise schedule, and transferred
chocolate shop responsibilities to my wife. That helped but there were still
some issues. I wasn't as fast as I could be when completing tasks. I wasn't
context switching efficiently. I saw the benefits people were experiencing with
AI and I decided to try it for myself.

## How I Use AI

Here's the content you came for. I embraced AI and use it in the following ways.
By no means are these the only ways to use AI, but I found value in them and
they worked for me.

### To Complete Tasks Faster 

I'm a competent person both personally and professionally. I can complete pretty
much any project you assign me, given time. However, I'm only one person with
limited capacity. I use AI agents to complete tasks faster and significantly
increase my output.

What does this look like in practice? I have my Helix editor open in one
terminal and one or more AI agents (e.g., Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) open in
other terminals. I'm not against GUI editors (e.g., Zed, Cursor) but I've always
favored the terminal so I like AI agents that allow me to stay in the terminal.
I then edit the code, the plan, and the agent rules and ask an AI agent to
complete tasks for me. Review a change. Implement a feature. Write tests.
Whatever, really. In between prompts I use `jj` to describe and commit the work
so that I have the ability to easily undo it.

Here's some work that I completed using an AI agent.

* [oxidecomputer/terraform-provider-oxide#427][terraform-provider-oxide#427]
* [oxidecomputer/terraform-provider-oxide#443][terraform-provider-oxide#443]
* [oxidecomputer/rancher-machine-driver-oxide#40][rancher-machine-driver-oxide#40]

I spend less time typing, which is great since we all have a finite number of
keystrokes left in our lives and can eventually suffer pain in our hands and
wrists. Instead, I have AI agents make as many keystrokes as needed to solve
the task I've assigned it to do. Far more keystrokes than I would have ever been
able to make in my lifetime.

I can better compete with myself and others. I don't have the luxury of time
where I can be on my computer 24/7 brute forcing my way through work. I do,
however, have the luxury of experience, and with AI agents I can assign them
work and get done in minutes what would have taken me hours.

I love learning, particularly understanding how things work through experience
and by talking with experts. With AI agents I can discuss resources to broaden
and deepen my experience much like I would with a human, without the constraints
of interest and stamina. I then use that experience to adjust how I work with AI
agents.

I can do more. Type more. Compete more. Learn more. All using AI.

### To Facilitate Context Switching

I was the first hire for a new role at [Oxide Computer Company][oxide-computer],
which I discussed at length in the [Solutions Software Engineering with Matthew
Sanabria][oxide-friends-s5-e16] episode of the Oxide & Friends podcast. The
nature of being the first hire in a role meant I was often working alone and had
to context switch between tasks. I use AI agents to facilitate context switching
and shorten the time it takes to start and stop work.

What does this look like in practice? I configure AI agents to automatically
perform tasks without confirmation and kick off deep research for things I need
more information on. There's nothing particularly novel with _what_ I'm doing
here, but I did want to focus on _when_ I'm doing these things.

I found that I wasn't using my time as efficiently as I wanted to when context
switching. This manifested itself in a few ways, but usually occurred when
starting or stopping work. Throughout the day there are events that occur that
pull you away from work. Meetings. Lunch. Walking the dog. Whatever. In order to
action these events you have to stop your current work and context switch to the
event. When the event is finished you have to context switch back to the work.
That context switching can be difficult and a time sink if not careful.

Many people tackle this by restructuring their schedule to allow blocks of focus
time and meeting time. However, that's not always practical nor does it help
with events that happen on short notice. It also doesn't help if you're like
me and have a difficult time putting something down when you're already in the
zone.

I've started using AI as a demarcation point for starting and stopping work
and it's helped me immensely. Before I action an event I task an AI agent with
continuing the work that I was doing so that I can check in on it afterwards.
In the time between events I review the work from an AI agent, ask it to
adjust its approach, and kick off another task. Rinse and repeat. All those
30-minute blocks of time between events just became far more productive and less
exhausting. At the end of the day I've done the same or more work than I usually
do but my brain is not exhausted like it once was. I have mental capacity left
over to tackle my other responsibilities.

I also use AI to balance multiple projects. I leave AI agent sessions open so I
can pick right up where I left off rather than spending time loading context. If
I'm still unsure I can just ask an AI agent. This allows me to balance multiple
projects and make concurrent progress on those projects. Instead of me doing
100% of the work across multiple projects serially I can have AI agents do 80%
of the work concurrently and I'll do the remaining 20% of work myself. Now for
the same 100% of work I can ship multiple projects instead of one. Amazing!

I liken this efficiency in context switching and balancing of multiple projects
to the game of keeping balloons in the air. Each project is a balloon and you
need to context switch in order to hit a balloon higher to keep it off the
floor. By myself I can only keep a certain number of balloons in the air at a
time. With AI I can keep a higher number of balloons in the air or focus on a
smaller number of balloons that I hit extremely high and don't have to come back
to for a while. Either way, I'm not overexerting myself and I'm still completing
all the work I needed to and wanted to.

I can context switch faster. Start faster. Stop faster. Balance more concurrent
projects. All using AI.

## What Does This Mean for Adults?

If you're an adult reading this you'll have to answer this question for
yourself. I'll tell you what it means to me though to hopefully inspire you.

I have significantly reduced the risk that AI will take my job. I never feared
this personally but I did acknowledge that I don't have the time I once did
when I was younger and that does affect how much I can do in a day. My use of AI
allows me to stay competitive even as my responsibilities increase in life. I'm
not a parent but I know this will benefit me when I am one.

I have a better work/life balance. I can step away to go to the gym, cook food,
walk my dogs, and even just take a break to recharge. All without losing much
productivity. All without feeling pressure to stay in my chair and code. This
is such a freeing feeling. It allows me to do my best work while living my best
life.

I have more capacity and energy to things that require my human skills and
experience. I can write documentation and blog posts for a human audience. I can
create content that helps people. I can build rapport with customers and users
to better understand their use cases. I can set the strategy and vision for my
team. I'm not too busy to talk to a human because I'm keeping AI agents busy
to free me to be human. That's a wonderful feeling. After all, what good is the
work we do if it doesn't positively impact others?

Hopefully this inspired you to reflect on how you can embrace AI as an adult.
Like most things in technology, AI is constantly changing. There's no right or
wrong time to embrace AI. There's no right or wrong AI tool to use. There's no
right or wrong amount of AI to use. Try the popular AI tools. Try different AI
tools. Try them long enough to form an opinion for yourself. Sure, the way you've
been working will change because of it, but I'm willing to bet it'll change for
the better.
