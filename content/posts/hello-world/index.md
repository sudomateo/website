It's about time I started writing more.

I've spent a lot of time in my life writing software, mentoring others,
debugging interesting problems, and speaking with others about technology. While
I've documented some of that on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7los1CzimITtvYjOQFqyrQ), overall
I've done a poor job of documenting my journey.

I created this website to change that. I'll be documenting things more, writing
about technology and my other interests, and just getting information out there
for myself and others to reference and benefit from.

Stay tuned for more content on this website! Meanwhile, feel free to learn more
[about me](/about).
