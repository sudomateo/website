This post contains my personal salary transparency data, inspired by [Xe Iaso's
salary transparency][1] page. My motivation for posting this is to give people
information they can use in their career and inspire people to openly talk about
compensation without being stigmatized.

## Thoughts on Salary Transparency

Here are some of my thoughts related to salary tranparency that I've built up
over the years, especially after working for a company that [publicly posts its
compensation information][2]. I hope these thoughts will speak to you and help
you in your journey.

- Money isn't an idol in my life. You can't just buy my time because you offered
me more money than what you see here. I'm not trying to optimize my life or
looking to switch roles every year just to get paid more. There's more to life
than just money and I'm very well compensated in those areas of my life.
- You don't pay me. I don't pay you. The company pays us. Don't get jealous or
mad if I get paid more than you in a similar role or with similar experience.
I won't get mad or jealous towards you either. It doesn't matter if we're
teammates or strangers. You knowing my salary isn't going to stop me from
pursuing my goals and me knowing your salary shouldn't stop you from pursuing
your goals.
- Wealthy people are generally transparent about their salary. Yes, most of
these wealthy people are _forced_ to be transparent (e.g., officer in public
company, public official), but I believe salary transparency helps develop a
wealthy mindset. It's always pissed me off that investment firms like Fidelity
and Charles Schwab are all around wealthy neighborhoods while impoverished
neighborhoods get multiple liquor stores and strip clubs. No wonder why
impoverished neighborhoods stay impoverished. Their mindset isn't given a chance
to change.
- It's okay to encourage yourself and others to discuss salary transparency,
especially if you have the privilege to do so. I've spoken up about salary
transparency at past employers. I've even managed a Slack channel named
`#talk-pay` where employees could anononymously post their compensation
information. I caught flack for that. I received direct messages from managers
and directors asking me to stop. Did I stop? No. Do I regret that? Not one bit.
Especially not after the countles direct messages from employees thanking me
for speaking up about salary transparency and recounting how it's helped them in
their career.
- I'm not embarrassed about anything listed here. I'm sure I could be getting
paid more right now or could have climbed the career ladder faster if spent
more time studying earlier in my career rather than chasing women or playing
video games. Who cares!? That's life! I didn't start programming in my
childhood like many do today. Instead, I played baseball and manhunt outside
with my friends. I'm sure there are teenagers that can run circles around me in
programming. I could be embarrassed by that but I _choose_ not to be. Similar
to the "money isn’t an idol" point above there’s no point in treating your
life like a min/max challenge. Live a full life, know who you are, and own your
journey getting here.

## Salary History

Here's my salary history for all the full-time jobs I've had throughout my
career. The information listed here does not contain data about stock options,
bonuses, or any other compensation outside of annual salary. I opted to exclude
that data since bonuses are not guaranteed and stock options can be worthless if
a company never goes public and, even if a company goes public, the value varies
depending on exercise price, market conditions, and sale price. I'm not opposed
to talking about those other aspects of compensation but there's so much nuance
that makes it difficult to present here.

I'll do my best to keep this table updated.
