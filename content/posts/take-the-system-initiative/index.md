Infrastructure as code is dead. Don't believe me? Read on.

Odds are you're familiar with infrastructure as code tools like Terraform,
OpenTofu, and Pulumi. Maybe you like these these tools and use them regularly.
Maybe you have a love-hate relationship with them. Regardless, you feel _some_
way about these tools. Have you ever stopped to wonder if there's something
better?

Answer the following questions for yourself.

- How quickly can you deploy infrastructure as code changes?
- How easily can you modify the upstream source code?
- Can you list all of the inputs, outputs, and dependencies for a resource?
- Do you have a high-level view of all your deployed resources?

For most people, the answers to those questions can be embarrassing. Let me
answer them for myself so you can see what I mean.

- How quickly can you deploy infrastructure as code changes?
  - However long it takes to get a code change reviewed and merged. Usually
  between minutes during working hours to hours or days otherwise.
- How easily can you modify the upstream source code?
  - Not that easy. I would have to fork the source code, modify it, build it,
  deploy it, and get it hooked up to the infrastructure as code tool. Would
  take more code reviews and possibly hours or days for the configuration.
- Can you list all of the inputs, outputs, and dependencies for a resource?
  - If everything is in the same code repository then probably with a good
  Language Server Protocol (LSP) configuration. Otherwise, I'll be using the
  documentation and good ole' `grep`.
- Do you have a high-level view of all your deployed resources?
  - Yes for those that are managed with some orchestration tool like Terraform
  Cloud, Spacelift, or Pulumi Cloud. Everything else would require reading
  state files or the like to build a graph of resources.

Sounds toilsome, doesn't it?

## Itâ€™s Time to Rebuild DevOps

In my opinion, much of the infrastructure as code pain comes from the fact that
the incumbent tools tightly couple themselves to a version control system. That
is, all of the toil that of version control systems is inherent in the design
of infrastructure as code. It's time to think about this differently. It's time
to rebuild DevOps. Thankfully, one company is doing just that- and that company
is [System Initiative][system-initiative].

System Initiative abandons infrastructure as code for infrastructure as models
and it's unlike anything I've worked with thus far. The interface is an
interactive architecture diagram that forms a graph whose nodes and edges are
powered by reactive, configurable functions. I know that sounds a bit like
technical workplay so let me use more plain language. Imagine being able to
click on a resource in your architecture diagram, edit the code that manages
it, and view a dry-run of the results before deciding to apply those changes.
That's System Initiative, and its extensibility and short feedback loop are
_so_ refreshing compared to incumbent tools.

The following image shows what one of those architecture diagrams looks like on
the System Initiative canvas.

There's a large green box containing 2 small yellow boxes representing SSH
public keys and 1 red box representing a project that itself contains 3 small
green boxes representing compute
instances.][system-initiative-oxide-diagram-instance]

This canvas manages resources on an [Oxide][oxide] computer. Mind you, System
Initiative didn't ship with support for managing Oxide resources. I added that
support from scratch in under 30 minutes. More on that later.

Do you see the power yet?

## System Initiative Concepts

Before I show you how I added support for those Oxide resources let's talk
about the concepts in System Initiative. In System Initiative, you create an
asset to manage a resource. Assets can have one or more functions attached to
them, and those functions can be one of the following types.

- **Action** - Performs an operation on an asset. Typically these are create,
read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations but can be customized to perform
_any_ operation (e.g., restart an instance).
- **Attribute** -  Sets a value for an attribute on the asset (e.g., name, ID).
Can be used to populate input and output sockets for use by other assets.
- **Authentication** - Configures authentication for an asset so that the asset
can communication with an upstream API.
- **Code Generation** - Converts information about an asset into other formats
(e.g., JSON, YAML) that can be used in other functions.
- **Qualification** - Validates information about an asset (e.g., valid
region). Used to block potentially dangerous operations.

When you place an asset on the canvas it can either be a component or a
configuration frame. Here's the general difference between the two.

- **Component** - Asset that manages a resource. Can have input and output
sockets connecting to and from other assets. Cannot contain nested assets.
- **Configuration Frame** - Asset that can contain nested assets. Any child
asset will automatically have its input sockets populated from the output
sockets of its parent. Can also manage a resource if desired.

The following image shows what components and configuration frames look like on
the System Initiative canvas.

![The System Initiative canvas showing a large green configuration frame box
that contains 3 small yellow component boxes
within.][system-initiative-asset-explanation]

This canvas has one `API Credential` configuration frame with three `SSH Public
Key` components nested within. The `API Credential` configuration frame has an
output socket named `API Credential` and the `SSH Public Key` components accept
an input socket named `API Credential`. Since the components are nested within
the configuration frame, the `API Credential` input sockets are automatically
populated from the output socket.

## Developing Assets

System Initiative ships with built-in support for many AWS assets with more
launching each week. However, System Initiative is meant to be extensible via a
fast feedback loop and I wanted to see just how fast that feedback loop was by
developing new assets.

My friends over at Oxide gave me access to a preview environment so I decided
to develop new System Initiative assets to manage Oxide resources. I was going
into this completely from scratch with zero context. I've never developed an
asset in System Initiative before and I haven't used the Oxide API.

As you now know, assets are just a collection of functions. There's nothing
stopping us from modifying existing assets or creating entirely new assets of
our own. We only need to know how to write TypeScript functions. Having written
infrastructure as code providers previously I expected to spend hours creating
these new Oxide assets. Nope! In under 30 minutes I was able to develop the
following new Oxide assets with support for create, read, and delete
operations.

- `Oxide API Credential` - A configuration frame to hold API credentials to
communicate with the Oxide API.
- `Oxide SSH Public Key` - A component to manage an SSH public key.

Think about that for a second. 30 minutes to develop completely new assets.
That's mind-blowingly fast considering I started from scratch.

Before I show you the code for these assets I wanted to backtrack to function
types. Earlier I said there were five function types but there's really one
more function type that every asset must have. I don't believe there's an
official name for this function type so I'm going to call it the model function
type for the sake of this post. The purpose of this function is to define the
structure of an asset using properties. There are different types of properties
in System Initiative (e.g., properties, secrets, input and output sockets) but
I won't go into too much detail about them in this post.

### Oxide API Credential

The first asset I created was `Oxide API Credential`. Initially I configured it
as a component but after some thinking I switched it to a configuration frame
so I can nest other assets within. Don't fret about this too much, a user can
select whether an asset is a component or a configuration frame when they place
it on the canvas. The asset author just gets to configure the default type.
Let's see what the code looks like.

The following model function defines one secret property named `API Credential`
with two child properties named `API Token` and `Endpoint` that will be set by
the user on the canvas. If the `API Credential` name sounds familiar to you its
because I mentioned it earlier when talking about input and output sockets. The
secret property is special in System Initiative- it's also an output socket.

```ts
function main() {
    const apiCredentialSecret = new SecretDefinitionBuilder()
        .setName("API Credential")
        .addProp(
            new PropBuilder()
            .setName("API Token")
            .setKind("string")
            .setWidget(
                new PropWidgetDefinitionBuilder()
                .setKind("password")
                .build()
            ).build())
        .addProp(
            new PropBuilder()
            .setName("Endpoint")
            .setKind("string")
            .setWidget(
                new PropWidgetDefinitionBuilder()
                .setKind("text")
                .build()
            ).build())
        .build();

    return new AssetBuilder()
        .defineSecret(apiCredentialSecret)
        .build();
}
```

Since this asset will hold authentication information I created the following
authentication function that reads the `API Token` and `Endpoint` from the
secret created in the model function and stores them in request-scoped storage
for the asset. This request-scoped storage is accessible by all the functions
in the asset during execution.

```ts
async function main(secret: Input): Promise < Output > {
    console.log("Configuring API Credential...")
    requestStorage.setEnv("OXIDE_TOKEN", secret["API Token"]);
    requestStorage.setEnv("OXIDE_HOST", secret["Endpoint"]);
}
```

I used the following qualification function to validate that the Oxide API is
reachable with valid credentials. It retrieves the API token and endpoint from
the request-scoped storage and uses them to make an API request to the Oxide
API. If no error is reached the qualification succeeds and lets this asset and
its dependencies continue execution. In the System Initiative interfaces
there's a **Function Depends on Secrets** toggle to let System Initiative know
to run the authentication function before the qualification function. Make sure
to enable that.

```ts
async function main(component: Input): Promise < Output > {
    const apiToken = requestStorage.getEnv("OXIDE_TOKEN");
    const host = requestStorage.getEnv("OXIDE_HOST");

    if ((!apiToken) && (!host)) {
        return {
            result: 'failure',
            message: 'Oxide API token and host must be set!'
        };
    }

    const apiURL = `${host}/v1/me`;

    const response = await fetch(apiURL, {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiToken}`
        }
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
        const data = await response.text()

        return {
            result: 'failure',
            message: `HTTP error! Status: ${response.status}, Body: ${data}`
        };
    }

    return {
        result: 'success',
        message: 'API Credential qualified!'
    };
}
```

### Oxide SSH Public Key 

The second asset I created was `Oxide SSH Public Key`. This is a component that
manages an SSH public key within Oxide. Let's see what the code looks like.

This action function creates an SSH public key. In the System Initiative
interface there's a **This action creates a resource** toggle to let System
Initiative know this function creates a resource. Make sure to enable that.
Notice the function returns the API response via the `payload` attribute. We'll
use that in other functions.

```ts
async function main(component: Input): Promise < Output > {
    const apiToken = requestStorage.getEnv("OXIDE_TOKEN");
    const host = requestStorage.getEnv("OXIDE_HOST");

    if ((!apiToken) && (!host)) {
        return {
            status: "error",
            message: "Oxide API token and host must be set!"
        };
    }

    const apiURL = `${host}/v1/me/ssh-keys`;

    const payload = {
        "name": component.properties.domain?.Name,
        "description": component.properties.domain?.Description,
        "public_key": component.properties.domain?.["Public Key"]
    };

    const response = await fetch(`${apiURL}`, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiToken}`,
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
        const data = await response.text()
        return {
            status: "error",
            message: `Error from Oxide API: Status: ${response.status}, Body: ${data}`
        }
    }

    const data = await response.json()

    return {
        payload: data,
        status: "ok"
    };
}
```

This action function reads an SSH public key. In the System Initiative
interface there's a **This action refreshes a resource** toggle to let System
Initiative know this function reads a resource. Make sure to enable that.

```ts
async function main(component: Input): Promise < Output > {
    const apiToken = requestStorage.getEnv("OXIDE_TOKEN");
    const host = requestStorage.getEnv("OXIDE_HOST");

    if ((!apiToken) && (!host)) {
        return {
            status: "error",
            message: "Oxide API token and host must be set!"
        };
    }

    const sshPublicKeyID = component.properties.resource?.payload?.id

    if (!sshPublicKeyID) {
        return {
            status: "error",
            message: "SSH public key ID must be provided!"
        };
    }

    const apiURL = `${host}/v1/me/ssh-keys/${sshPublicKeyID}`;

    const response = await fetch(`${apiURL}`, {
        method: "GET",
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiToken}`
        }
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
        const data = await response.text()
        return {
            status: "error",
            message: `Error from Oxide API: Status: ${response.status}, Body: ${data}`
        }
    }

    const data = await response.json()

    return {
        payload: data,
        status: "ok"
    };
}
```

Remember that `payload` we returned in the create function? We use it in this
refresh function to pull out the ID of the SSH public key. We need that ID to
fetch the correct SSH public key.

```ts
const sshPublicKeyID = component.properties.resource?.payload?.id
```

This action function deletes an SSH public key. In the System Initiative
interface there's a **This action deletes a resource** toggle to let System
Initiative know this function deletes a resource. Make sure to enable that.

```ts
async function main(component: Input): Promise < Output > {
    const apiToken = requestStorage.getEnv("OXIDE_TOKEN");
    const host = requestStorage.getEnv("OXIDE_HOST");

    if ((!apiToken) && (!host)) {
        return {
            status: "error",
            message: "Oxide API token and host must be set!"
        };
    }

    const sshPublicKeyID = component.properties.resource?.payload?.id

    if (!sshPublicKeyID) {
        return {
            status: "error",
            message: "SSH public key ID must be provided!"
        };
    }

    const apiURL = `${host}/v1/me/ssh-keys/${sshPublicKeyID}`;

    const response = await fetch(`${apiURL}`, {
        method: "DELETE",
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiToken}`
        }
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
        const data = await response.text()
        return {
            status: "error",
            message: `Error from Oxide API: Status: ${response.status}, Body: ${data}`
        }
    }

    return {
        status: "ok"
    };
}
```

Much like the refresh function, this delete function retrieves the ID for the
SSH public key from `payload`. Notice that this delete function does not return
any `payload` itself. That's because at this point the resource will have been
deleted so there's no payload to return.

## Are You Ready to Take the System Initiative?

I hope you can see just how powerful a tool like System Initiative can be in
the hands of an engineer. Perhaps you're already thinking of assets that you'd
write to integrate with the tools you use.

If you're ready to take the System Initiative, go ahead and sign up sign up on
their [website][system-initiative]. There's even a [Discord
server][system-initiative-discord] if you'd like to be part of the community.
If that's too much commitment but you still want to support System Initiative
then go ahead and give a listen to the [The diagram IS the
code][system-initiative-shipit] episode where two engineers from System
Initiative discuss more about the platform and its architecture.

Thank you System Initiative for giving me early access to the beta. I look
forward to the eventual public launch and will continue to port my existing
infrastructure over to System Initiative as I get the time to.

For my dear reader, are you ready to take the System Initiative?
