There's been an influx of people telling others to develop taste to use AI.
Designers. Marketers. Developers. All of them touting the same message. It's
ironic, though. These are the same people who never questioned why their designs
all look identical, never iterated beyond the first draft, and never asked if
their work actually solved the problem at hand.

They're not alone. The loudest voices preaching about taste and AI are often the
ones who never demonstrated taste before AI.

## What is Taste?

The technology industry has a tendency to use words that mean multiple things
without describing which definition they are referring to. When I read about
taste and AI I usually see people referring to the following definition.

> Critical judgment, discernment, or appreciation of aesthetic quality.

In the context of AI, this definition manifests itself in several ways.

**Contextual Appropriateness**: Knowing when AI-generated content fits the
situation and when it doesn't. Put another way, knowing when a human touch is
needed (e.g., a message to a loved one).

**Quality Recognition**: Being able to distinguish between useful AI-generated
content and slop. This requires domain knowledge to truly discern aesthetic
quality rather than just functional quality.

**Iterative Refinement**: Understanding that AI is a starting point that
requires further iteration. This point is most similar to how culinary taste is
applied to refine a dish by iterating on the recipe and presentation.

**Ethical Boundaries**: Recognizing when AI crosses the lines of authenticity,
legality, and respect. Basically, don't use AI to do bad things.

None of these skills are new. These are the same skills we should have been
applying to our work all along. Why are we asking about taste and AI now when
we should have been applying taste the whole time? Perhaps people advocating for
taste are telling on themselves.

## Being Tasteless

Some people have no taste. In the best case that may be due to lack of
experience but in the worst case it may be due to ignorance. I'm noticing that
many people worried about tasteless AI-generated content are often guilty of
producing tasteless content themselves, usually manifesting as the following.

* Copying and pasting code without understanding it.

* Sending resumes and emails that aren't proofread and edited.

* Asking others to review code without giving it a self review.

* Noticing a quality issue and failing to document or fix it.

* Designing websites that look exactly like every other company's website.

* Regurgitating content from the trending influencer of the week.

Where's the taste here? Where's the critical judgment, discernment, or
appreciation of aesthetic quality that separates mediocrity from excellence?

It's not there because most people haven't developed their taste yet. AI didn't
create this tasteless problem. People did. Now that everyone can generate
content at the speed of thought we're noticing that not all content is actually
good. To play on a popular quote from Ratatouille, anyone can cook, but not
everyone is a chef. Don't complain about mediocre work when you're producing
mediocre work yourself.

## Spectrum of Taste

What about the nature of taste itself? Should people focus on developing depth
of taste in specific domains or breadth of taste across many domains? My short
answer is a bit of both, if possible.

Depth of taste means becoming an expert within a particular domain. We've all
met such experts and even asked them for help on tricky, bespoke topics within
their domain. A person with depth of taste can recognize when AI-generated
content is refined and of high quality versus merely functional. This kind of
taste comes from years of experience in a specific role coupled with deep domain
knowledge.

Breadth of taste means becoming knowledgeable across multiple domains and
understanding how those domains interface with one another. A person with
breadth of taste can recognize when AI-generated content is contextually
appropriate, authentic, and of enough quality to use for their needs. This
kind of taste comes from years of experience across multiple roles coupled with
moderate domain knowledge.

Breadth of taste is more valuable with AI. When using AI, you're constantly
switching between domains: a software engineer writing documentation, a marketer
creating designs. Breadth lets you maintain quality across these contexts while
recognizing when you need domain expertise. You iterate faster because you have
opinions about what "good enough" looks like across multiple domains.

The people I see being most effective with AI developed a breadth of taste that
they use to determine what good AI-generated content looks like, regardless
of domain. They can recognize when something feels off, even if they can't
articulate exactly why. They understand their own limitations and know when to
seek expertise in a specific domain. That's not to say those with depth of taste
can't be successful with AI, but I see those people reluctant to use AI because
they are more knowledgeable than AI in a particular domain.

## It Tastes Bitter

If you're reading this thinking you have to spend time developing your taste,
good! Perhaps I've left a bitter taste in your mouth. The good news is you're
not alone. There are many people that need to hear this to better their
taste, myself included. The challenge here is recognizing that it's not about
developing taste for AI but rather about developing taste, period. If you've had
poor taste before AI you'll have poor taste with AI. If you've had good taste
before AI, you'll be able to apply that taste with AI.

Instead of treating AI taste as some mystical new skill, focus on the
fundamentals that were always important. Here are some actionable ways to
develop your taste.

**Tomorrow**: Pick one piece of work you're proud of and one you're not.
Write down specifically what makes them different. That's taste in action.

**This week**: Find three examples of excellence in a domain you work in. Study
them. What patterns emerge? What choices did the creators make?

**This month**: Take something you've created with or without AI and iterate
on it a few times. Each iteration should have a specific improvement based on a
specific critique.

**Always**: When someone preaches about AI taste, ask them to show you their
work from before AI. If they can't demonstrate taste in their pre-AI work,
they're not qualified to lecture you about it now.

The people succeeding with AI aren't the ones who suddenly discovered taste.
They're the ones who already had it and simply adapted their standards to a
new tool. Develop your taste with or without AI. The medium doesn't matter, the
fundamentals do.

Stop waiting for AI to force you to develop taste. Start now.
